**DISH 2018** is a startup challenge that aims to enable Metro-Manila based developers to prototype and build relevant and sustainable platforms using blockchain technology.  It will be led and organised by the leading blockchain organizations and communities in the Philippines towards the goal of promoting blockchain use case design and engineering skill awareness for potential local talent that will hopefully culminate in a wider hiring pool for participating blockchain companies.  

As a primer to DISH, the blockchain community will be hosting DAppetiser (https://www.meetup.com/blockdevsasia/events/255790578/?isFirstPublish=true) on Thursday, November 8th at 7:30PM. Taking place in The Bottle Shop BGC, this introductory networking session is meant to connect all organizers and participants in one location. In any case, if youâ€™re interested in learning more about DISH, looking to join a team, or just want to casually network with people from the community, then this meetup is for you!
